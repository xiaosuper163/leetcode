# Leetcode 
Leetcode coding practices

The code is written in python, csharp or javascript. I try to solve at least one problem everyday until the most frequent 300 problems are solved. The purpose is to keep my brain active. Also I try to push myself to code everyday after work. I chose those three programming languages to make sure I won't forget the syntax of each programming language.

  - **Phase one**: solve the most frequent 300 problems. (Dec 2018 - Present)
  - **Phase two**: solve the most frequent 300 problems for the second round. Make sure the time complexity and extra space are optimized. Add more comment lines to explain the solution. At meanwhile, start solving the ood problems. (Time: TBD)
  - **Phase three**: solve the most frequent 300 problems for the third round. Read the discussions of each problem and understand all the posible solutions. (Time: TBD)
