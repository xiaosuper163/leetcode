# Leetcode 
Leetcode coding practices

The code is written in python, csharp or javascript. I try to solve at least one problem everyday until the most frequent 300 problems are solved. The purpose is to keep my brain active. I chose those three programming languages to make sure I won't forget the syntax of each programming language.

  - **Phase one**: solve the most frequent 300 problems. (Dec 2018 - Present)
  - **Phase two**: solve the most frequent 300 problems for the second round. Make sure the time complexity and space complexity are optimized. (Time: TBD)
  - **Phase three**: solve the most frequent 300 problems for the three round. Read the discussions of each problem. (Time: TBD)
